effect_sp1_on_sp2,"the effect of species1 on species2: 1, -1 or 0"
effect_sp2_on_sp1,"the effect of species2 on species1: 1, -1 or 0"
interaction,"type of interaction: competition, predation, commensalism (where one species benefits and the other receives no effect), kleptoparasitism (e.g., steeling food or nest material), brood parasitism (where one species places its egg in another species' nest), other parasitism, nest takeover (where one species takes over the nest of another species), facilitation (e.g., where both species benefit, e.g., mixed flock), facilitation-comigration (where species migrate together), communal nesting (nesting together, usually during nonbreeding season), mobbing. Note that ""mobbing"" is usually indicative of predation, where the smaller bird mobs the bigger bird. If you come across ""mobbing"" the species doing the mobbing (usually potential prey) gets a 1 and the species receiving the mobbing gets a -1 (the potential predator). This is because mobbing is almost always deterring a predator, so the predator loses out. "
