# DATA INPUT:     Imports L0 raw species list data from the USGS North American Breeding Bird Survey (SpeciesList.txt is updated every year).
# DATA OUTPUT:    L0 data: bbs_specieslist_2023_L0.csv - this is a copy of the raw data, just omitting the top lines without data

Older code when the file read in was in .txt. format and had many lines in the beginning to ignore:
This function determines if a species is "valid" by looking at its latin and
common names.  It is called below to read in the data.

validateSpecies = function(){

# On older versions the first 10 lines do not contain data; read in first 12 lines which contain column names in 12th line
skip = readLines(file.path(L0_dir,"BBS_SpeciesListL0.txt"), n = 12)

# The 11th line has column names separated by lots of spaces
column.names = grep(".$", strsplit(skip[11], " ")[[1]], value = TRUE)

# The 12th line has dashes that can be used for determining column widths
dashes = skip[12]

## PLZ suggests NOT INCLUDING THIS in resulting subsetting below bc it would remove 95 species##
