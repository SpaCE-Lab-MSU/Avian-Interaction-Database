species1_scientific,genus species subspecies (if present) for species1
species2_scientific,genus species subspecies (if present) for species2
species1_common,optional for entry: common name of species1 according to BOW; we will also fill in via R
species2_common,optional for entry: common name of species2 according to BOW; we will also fill in via R
effect_sp1_on_sp2,"the effect of species1 on species2: 1, -1 or 0"
effect_sp2_on_sp1,"the effect of species2 on species1: 1, -1 or 0"
interaction,"see AvianInteractionData_metadata_interactiondefinitions.csv for type of interaction: competition, predation, commensalism (where one species benefits and the other receives no effect), kleptoparasitism (e.g., steeling food or nest material), brood parasitism (where one species places its egg in another species' nest), other parasitism, nest takeover (where one species takes over the nest of another species), facilitation (e.g., where both species benefit, e.g., mixed flock), facilitation-comigration (where species migrate together), communal nesting (nesting together, usually during nonbreeding season), mobbing. Note that ""mobbing"" is usually indicative of predation, where the smaller bird mobs the bigger bird. If you come across ""mobbing"" the species doing the mobbing (usually potential prey) gets a 1 and the species receiving the mobbing gets a -1 (the potential predator). This is because mobbing is almost always deterring a predator, so the predator loses out. "
interaction_strength,"""weak"" or ""strong"" evidence of the interaction, gauged by qualitative description or quantitative "
species1_lifestage,"Enter the lifestage appropriate to the interaction, for species 1. If there are multiple lifestages for a given species, enter them in the same cell, separated by "";"". For example, with Brood Parasites, the interactions involved include BOTH adult and nestlings. Egg would be unborn individuals. Nestlings are individuals who have hatched and remain within a nest. Fledglings are young who have fledged but are not yet old enough to fend for themselves. Juvenile is a stage following fledgling but not yet fully mature Adult. If there is no description of a lifestage, leave this blank."
species2_lifestage,"Enter the lifestage appropriate to the interaction, for species 2. If there are multiple lifestages for a given species, enter them in the same cell, separated by "";"". For example, with Brood Parasites, the interactions involved include BOTH adult and nestlings. Egg would be unborn individuals. Nestlings are individuals who have hatched and remain within a nest.

If there is no description of a lifestage, leave this blank."
time_of_year,"Enter the time of year that the interaction occurs in. This should be month(s), seasons, or ""year-round"". If nothing is reported, go to the original source to determine the time of year. If you are unsure of what timeframe the interaction occurs in, check with a reviewer (Phoebe or Caroline)"
breeding_migration,"Enter the life history timing of the interaction (year-round, migration, breeding, non-breeding) or some combination separated by "";"" (e.g., breeding; migration). For example, if the interaction occurs during the non-breeding season (typically winter), indicate ""non-breeding"". "
source_citation,"Enter the complete citation for the source in MLA style, including the DOI. You can include the URL also, but that should be pasted in the next column. BOW citations are found at the bottom of each BOW species' account."
source_URL,"the  URL of the source. For BOW: copy-paste BOW URL for the specific page referring to this interaction (e.g., ""https://birdsoftheworld-org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/bow/species/norgos/cur/introduction"""
text_excerpt,"copy-paste the paragraph (or longer) containing all the information related to this interaction. For BOW: include section headings with ':'. If there are multiple sections of text from the same page associated with source_URL, then include the section heading (e.g., ""Nonpredatory interactions"" ) followed by "":"" and separate the multiple sections of text with ""..."""
recorder,"the name of the person entering the data; when checking, add ""/"" between your names (e.g. Emily Parker/PLZ)"
entry_date,"the date the recorder entered the record; if you are adding to an existing record, add "";"" between dates (e.g., 3/3/2014; 2/2/2022)"
uncertain_interaction,use uncertain interaction keyword that best describes interaction (see AvianInteractionData_metadata_uncertain.csv); can add additional information to note that provides additional context
entry_changes,"For checking/updating: IF the original entry was changed indicate who changed the original entry, what was changed, and the date. for example: ""PLZ changed interaction from competition to predation on 4/3/2022""."
name_changes, for differences between scientific/common name of species in article and BOW; list name used in article and current name in BOW
other_species1,"for multi-species interactions, enter yes when species1 is not the same as the species listed in the file name"
DatabaseSearchURL," ""the URL for the Web of Science or Scopus or Google Scholar Search results"""
