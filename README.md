# Avian Interaction Database 
This repository contains code and workflows for the The Avian Interaction Database project, initially focusing on North America. Starting in 2019, a new protocol was established and the previous records were updated and further bird-bird interactions were added in by Zarnetske and MSU SpaCE Lab undergraduates (2019-present). The database is in preparation for publication as an open access data paper. From 2012-2014, Zarnetske and Zonneveld compiled bird-bird interactions among cavity nesting birds and their interacting bird species, based on species accounts in the Birds of North America (now Birds of the World). This led to an analysis of the influence of biotic interactions on North American cavity nesting bird species distributions ([Belmaker and Zarnetske et al. 2015 GEB](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.12311)). 

MSU Undergraduates led the presentation of a research poster at the 2024 [MSU Undergraduate University Research and Arts Forum](https://urca.msu.edu/uuraf):

DePasquale, G., I. Hirschowitz, C. Roche, E.G. Parker, P. Bills, P.L. Zarnetske. April 2024. The North American Avian Interaction Database. Michigan State University Undergraduate Research and Arts Forum (UURAF). East Lansing, MI. Poster Presentation.

## Location of data

These data are stored in this repository, accessible by collaborators. Once published, the North American Avian Interaction Database will be made open access.

## Workflow

The workflow for this repository follows the guidelines set out by the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)]((https://edirepository.org/)). Briefly, this involves aligning with FAIR data practices, and employing a workflow that uses different levels for harmonization and derived data products. The overall workflow aligns with this EDI diagram:

Order & description of scripts:

### For BBS analysis in North America: 
/R/bbs_specieslist_L0.R = reads in current BBS species list and adds any species that was split
/R/bbs_specieslist_L1.R = cleans the BBS species list, e.g., combining subspecies into species 

### For entire database: 
1. /R/AvianInteractionData_L0_stitch.R = stitches together all individual csvs in /L0/species and optionally /L0/species_in_review
2. /R/AvianInteractionData_L1.R = fixes species names, interaction codes, checks species name discrepencies based on current and past BOW names.  

## Description of subdirectories 

- **L0**: L0 (raw) data files = CSV files containing entries in the database from 2012-present; data entry procedure follows [/L0/AvianInteractionData_ENTRY_INSTRUCTIONS.md](L0/AvianInteractionData_ENTRY_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **L1**: L1 data; cleaned & edited L0 data. 
- **L2**: Derived data from L1 data (e.g., pulling in & checking data from other sources including: Hurlbert Bird Diet Database for North America: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01049-9 & https://github.com/hurlbertlab/dietdatabase)).
- **R**: Code to create L0 and L1 data.

## Funding 
Funding is provided by Michigan State University (to P.L. Zarnetske), and by a MSU Ecology Evolution, and Behavior SEED Grant (to P.L. Zarnetske). Original work on a subset of species was funded by the Yale Climate and Energy Institute (to P.L. Zarnetske), Erasmus Mundus Fellowship (to S. Zonneveld).
