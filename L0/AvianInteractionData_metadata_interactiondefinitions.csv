type_of_interaction,definition,note
competition,"competing over space, territory, food, etc. both species = -1",
predation,predator eats prey. predator = 1; prey = -1,
commensalism,"one species benefits and the other receives no effect (example: cavities are constructed by primary cavity nesting bird like a woodpecker, and later used by another bird for its own nest (without any conflict). species that benefits from the interaction = 1; species that provides the benefit = 0.",
kleptoparasitism,one species steals food or nest material from another species. species that steals and benefits = 1; species that is stolen from = -1,
brood parasitism,one species places its egg in another species' nest so the nesting species has to raise a conspecific (nest parasitism - includes egg-dumping). species that lays egg in another species nest = 1; species that has to care for the conspecific young = -1.,"From: https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/12/2/128/239797 ""Brood parasitism can take two forms in birds (Lack, 1968; Payne, 1977b; Yom-Tov, 1980; Rothstein, 1990): females lay in the nest of a conspecific (i.e., intraspecific parasitism), or in the nest of a female belonging to a different species (i.e., obligate interspecific parasitism). Intraspecific nest parasitism is much more common in birds that have self-feeding young (i.e., precocial species) (Rohwer and Freeman, 1989), whereas obligate interspecific parasitism essentially occurs in species where young need to be fed by parents (i.e., altricial species) (Lyon and Eadie, 1991)."""
nest takeover,"where one species takes over (steals) the nest of another species, sometimes kicking out the existing eggs. species that takes over = 1; species whose nest is stolen = -1",
facilitation,"where both species benefit (if we do not have a specific interaction for it), e.g., creching, mutual allopreening. both species = 1",
facilitation-mixed flocking,"where both species benefit by being in a group, both species = 1",
facilitation-comigration,special case of facilitation where species migrate together. both species = 1,
facilitation-feeding,"case of facilitation when both species feed together, either in mixed-flocks or feeding aggregations; both species = 1",
communal nesting,"nesting together, usually during breeding season. both species = 1",
mobbing,"usually indicative of predation, where the smaller bird mobs the bigger bird. The species doing the mobbing (usually potential prey) = 0; the species receiving the mobbing = -1 (the potential predator). This is because mobbing is almost always deterring a predator, so the predator loses out.",
co-occur,occur together but not clear what the interaction is. each species = 0,
commensalism-scavenge,case of commensalism in which a bird consumes/scavanges a previously deceased bird or deserted/addled eggs: scavenger=1; dead bird=0,
communal roosting,"roosting together, typically during nonbreeding season (indicate in ""nonbreedingseason"" column). both species = 1",
commensalism-chick adoption,"when one species adopts another species' chicks/eggs. Species that is adopting = 0 Species that is adopted = 1",
hybridization, when species successfully mate and produce hybrid offspring; includes intergrades (hybrids of subspecies). both species = 0,
amensalism,"one species causes harm to another species without any cost or benefits to itself (e.g. flushing from nest in response to perceived predator, accidental destruction of eggs); harmful species = 0, harmed species = -1",
copulation,unsuccessful mating attempt between two individuals of different species; both species = 0,
commensalism-call mimicry,"when one species copies the call/song of another; species that is mimicking = 1, species that is being mimicked = 0",
courtship,one species attempts to court another; both species = 0,
